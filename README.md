# hello-world
This is the first word i wrote when i attempted to code using the FCC resources
I got interested in coding/programming after realising that it is a skill that taught you how to think crotocally and promoted teamwork through asking colleagues how stuff is done especially when it comes to developing ideas and putting them in reality. I am self teaching myself using a multitude of resources following advices of senior developers that i just read about online and then try to implement their words of wisdom on my own.
